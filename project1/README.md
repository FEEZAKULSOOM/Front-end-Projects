# Amazon Clone

This is a simple front‑end clone of the Amazon website made with HTML and CSS. It focuses on the layout, design, and overall look of Amazon’s homepage and product sections.

It has no backend or interactive features. It’s only for learning basic web design, practicing styling, and building clean static pages.

Open the HTML files in your browser to see the design.
